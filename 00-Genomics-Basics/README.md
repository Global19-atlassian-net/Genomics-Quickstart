# Overview

Genomics is blessed/cursed with quite a rich vocabulary and concepts that sometimes make ideas hard to grok. In this intro section, I'll review some of the concepts that you'll need to be familiar with. I'll also provide additional resources that I've found useful that you can use to expand your knowledge.

# DNA Basics

In this section we review the biological terms and concepts that you should be familiar with. We define DNA, RNA, Chromosomes, Genes and introduce the central dogma. If you are just getting started, start here.

# Pipeline Basics

In this section we introduce genomic pipelines. Why they are necessary and the key steps involved. We cover reference genomces, alignment and variant calling and some basic analysis.

We'll also introduce some of the common workflow engines out there, mostly focusing on Cromwell, Nextflow and Snakemake.
