## Why did I create this and why does it matter?

There's a lot of information on genomics but it's geared for practioners.. If you are just
starting out it's easy to get overwhelmed.. **How do we put this all together into a single cohesive story?**

## My Goals

The goal for this quickstart is to give you the basics of what you need to get started,
while telling a cohesive easy to follow story.
