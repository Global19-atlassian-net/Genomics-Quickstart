# Genomics-Quickstart

The Data Science Lifecycle Process is a set of prescriptive steps and best practices to enable data science teams to consistently deliver value. It includes issue templates for common data science work types, a branching strategy that fits the data science development flow, and prescriptive guidance on how to piece together all the various tools and workflows required to make data science work.

## Why did we create this and why should you adopt it?

There's a lot of information on genomics but it's geared for practioners.. If you are just
starting out it's easy to get overwhelmed.. **How do we put this all together into a single workflow?**

## Design Goals

The goal for this quickstart is to give you the basics of what you need to get started,
while telling a cohesive easy to follow story.
